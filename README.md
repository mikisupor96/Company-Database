CP Database is a content management system designed for a fictitious company, according to the specifications provided by the customer. I developed all the front-end and back-end features using JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap for the front-end, and PHP and MySQL for the back-end. The system follows the CRUD principles across all tabs, which include Personnel, Department, and Location.
