# [CP Database](https://cpdatabase.herokuapp.com/)

CP Database is a `CMS system` designed for a fictional company based on a specification provided by 'the customer'. All the features front and back end were designed by me making use of `Javascript`, `Jquery`, and `Bootstrap` for the Front End and `PHP` and `MySql` for the Back End. The project makes use of `CRUD` principles across all tabs namely: Personnel, Department, Location.
